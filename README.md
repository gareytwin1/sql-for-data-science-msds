# MS-DS SQL Labs: Structured Query Language for Data Science

This repository contains my coursework for **Structured Query Language (SQL)** in the MS-DS program at the University of Colorado Boulder. It covers the origins and concepts of SQL and, more importantly, the practical use of **DDL**, **DML**, and **SELECT** for analysis in relational databases. The repo is organized for reproducibility, clean style, and future reuse.
