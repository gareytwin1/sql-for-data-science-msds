# MS-DS SQL Labs: Structured Query Language for Data Science

This repository contains my coursework for **Structured Query Language (SQL)** in the MS-DS program. It covers the origins and concepts of SQL and, more importantly, practical use of **DDL**, **DML**, and **SELECT** for analysis in relational databases. The repo is organized for reproducibility, clean style, and future reuse.

> **Scope:** Analytical queries (SELECT), schema design (DDL), data manipulation (DML), performance-minded patterns, and report-ready outputs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes (MS-DS Alignment)

- **Data Management:** Acquire, clean, wrangle, and manage data with SQL (imports, staging schemas, constraints).
- **EDA with SQL:** Perform exploratory data analyses using aggregations, windows, CTEs, and profiling.
- **Computational Techniques:** Apply summarization techniques (GROUP BY, window functions, rollups/cubes).
- **Storage & Access:** Understand representation, storage, indexing, and access paths for large datasets.
- **Collaboration:** Use issues, PRs, and reviews; document decisions and trade-offs.
- **Ethics:** Incorporate privacy, security, and responsible data use into SQL workflows.
